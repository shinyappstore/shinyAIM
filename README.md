# shinyAIM: Interactive Visualization of Manhattan Plots

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/shinyAIM](https://shinyappstore.com/a/shinyAIM)__

ShinyAIM is a Shiny-based application designed for interactive visualization of Manhattan plots in longitudinal genome-wide association studies. It allows users to dynamically explore and interpret results over multiple time points. Key features of ShinyAIM include interactive Manhattan plots for individual time points, a grid plot to view Manhattan plots across all time points simultaneously, dynamic scatter plots for selected markers, and interactive visualization of phenotypic data to capture phenotype variation and trends. Users can select a target time point, and an interactive Manhattan plot is generated, providing detailed marker information and p-values. Users can adjust the significance level, display a list of markers, and control the number of markers shown in the table below the plot. This tool offers valuable insights into longitudinal GWAS results. Original article: Plant Direct . 2018 Oct 24;2(10):e00091. doi: 10.1002/pld3.91. eCollection 2018 Oct.
